Magnus: Abstraction Dapp for Algorithmic Optimizing for Bitcoin Layer 2s
Welcome to Magnus! This repository hosts the code for a dynamic, cross-chain yield optimizer designed specifically for Bitcoin Layer 2s (L2s). Magnus offers a seamless platform where users can collateralize their Bitcoin to access liquidity in USDC, receiving competitive, risk-adjusted interest rates through algorithmic rebalancing based on each L2’s unique safety profile.

# Why Magnus?
Magnus addresses two critical issues facing Bitcoin L2 ecosystems:

High Cost of Capital: Bitcoin L2s often suffer from high borrowing costs, limiting liquidity and user adoption.

Fragmented Interoperability: Users currently face friction when interacting across various L2s, requiring multiple tools, chains, and bridges.

Magnus solves these problems by providing a unified, efficient marketplace where Bitcoin-backed assets can be leveraged across L2s with optimal interest rates. By assessing each L2’s risk profile, Magnus adjusts 

borrowing rates, offering lower costs to users willing to take on higher-risk L2s, while creating more liquidity for Bitcoin-based projects.

# Key Features
Dynamic, Risk-Adjusted Interest Rates: Magnus algorithmically adjusts interest rates based on the safety profile of each L2, providing users with cheaper capital on riskier networks while enabling safer networks to attract more liquidity.

Algorithmic Rebalancing: Our platform continuously rebalances funds across L2s, ensuring optimal lending rates and reducing user management overhead.

Inter-L2 Interoperability: Built as an abstraction layer, Magnus eliminates the need for multiple tools by integrating directly with prominent Bitcoin L2s, creating a seamless experience across the ecosystem.

Secure Collateralization: Users collateralize Bitcoin to borrow USDC, creating a reliable source of liquidity while safeguarding their assets.


# Integrated Bitcoin Layer 2s
Magnus currently supports the following Bitcoin L2s, each of which contributes unique strengths to our yield optimization platform:

Citrea: Citrea’s strong Bitcoin asset integrity forms a secure foundation for collateralized lending, giving our users peace of mind in managing their collateral.

Rootstock: Rootstock’s Ethereum-compatible smart contracts enable complex yield strategies on Bitcoin, which allows us to provide nuanced, highly-optimized interest rate adjustments.

Goat Network: Goat Network’s low-latency infrastructure ensures that users can access and transfer funds with minimal transaction costs, supporting efficient, real-time rebalancing across chains.

Fractal: Leveraging Fractal’s focus on privacy and transparency, Magnus provides users with a clear view into rates and lending options while ensuring data privacy is maintained.

Stackware: Stackware’s modular approach enables flexible and rapid rebalancing, which is essential for offering the best rates as market conditions fluctuate.

Rooch: Rooch’s performance-driven framework provides Magnus with reliable, high-speed transaction handling, ensuring users get competitive rates without delays.

Glittr: With Glittr’s composable infrastructure, Magnus integrates new yield strategies seamlessly, enhancing our ability to offer users the most profitable lending options.

BOB: BOB’s secure architecture helps protect collateral and lending operations, establishing a safe environment for Bitcoin-backed lending.



# Why Magnus is Crucial for Bitcoin L2s
Bitcoin L2s face a challenging landscape: fragmented tools, high costs, and underdeveloped liquidity channels. Magnus is the first platform to offer an integrated yield optimizer for Bitcoin L2s, addressing these challenges by creating a dynamic marketplace where users are empowered to leverage Bitcoin’s value at optimal rates. This platform is crucial because it:

Enhances Liquidity: By lowering capital costs for users willing to work with higher-risk L2s, Magnus stimulates liquidity across the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Simplifies User Experience: Our abstraction layer eliminates the need for multiple swapping tools and bridges, making cross-L2 transactions effortless.

Incentivizes L2 Innovation: Magnus’s risk-based interest model rewards safer, high-performing L2s while supporting emerging networks, encouraging L2s to optimize security and user experience.
